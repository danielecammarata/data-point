### BREAKING CHANGES

* **data-point:** only exposing a certain set of methods, if you depended on any method not listed here please create an Issue and we will do our best to address it.
* **data-point/core:** the signature for addEntityTypes has been changed
* **data-point/reducer-path:** $. is no longer supported as a special kind of path
* previously entities resolver would be skipped if value was invalid, you will now
have to make sure you are passing the right value to your entity or handle the error manually
* helpers.createResolveTransform is now called createReducerResolver, and the
function it returns no longer requires a resolveTransform parameter; helpers.createReducer no longer
requires a createTransform parameter

* docs(README): Add ReducerList to index of reducers in readme

* feat(helpers): Rename helpers.isTransform to helpers.isReducer
* isTransform was a function in the public API, and it is now replaced with isReducer
* **data-point/entities,reducers:** mapping an entity against a non `Array` will now return `undefined` (before it
would resolve as a single item), mapping with a reducer-path used to return `null`, it will now
return `undefined` if value is not an `Array`.
